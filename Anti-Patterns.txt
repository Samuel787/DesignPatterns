code smells

1. too many comments (unnecessary)
2. duplicate code
3. long method (long body)
4. Large classes -> god classes, blob classes, blackhole classes
5. Small classes -> data classes (can place other behavior inside this data classes)
6. Data clumps -> Many parameters (wrap them in an object) / global variables (but has their own problems)
7. Divergent change -> changing a class for many reasons
8. Shotgun surgery -> to make a change, must make changes everywhere
9. Feature envy -> have features that doesnt belong to itself
10. Message chains -> Violates Law of demeter:
a.getB().getC().doSomething();
11. primitive obsession
12. switch statements -> oop runtime
13.Speculative generality
14. refused bequest
